            A wireframe is a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a mobile app. It is used to illustrate the layout and functionality of an app before the actual design and development process begins. The main purpose of a wireframe is to provide a visual understanding of the app's structure, content, and functionality so that designers and developers can make informed decisions about the app's design and user experience. Wireframes are typically created using simple shapes, lines, and text to represent different UI elements, such as buttons, input fields, and navigation menus. They are often used in the early stages of the design process to explore different design ideas and to communicate design concepts to stakeholders.
